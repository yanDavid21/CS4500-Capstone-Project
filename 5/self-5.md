## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

The player should support five pieces of functionality: 

- `name`
- `propose board` (okay to be `void`)
- `setting up`
- `take a turn`
- `did I win`

Provide links. 

The referee functionality should compose at least four functions:

- setting up the player with initial information
- running rounds until termination
- running a single round (part of the preceding bullet)
- scoring the game

Point to two unit tests for the testing referee:

1. a unit test for the referee function that returns a unique winner
2. a unit test for the scoring function that returns several winners

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files -- in the last git-commit from Thursday evening. 

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
