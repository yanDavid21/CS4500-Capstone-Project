## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. point to the functinality for determining reachable tiles 

   - a data representation for "reachable tiles" 
   - its signature and purpose statement
   - its "cycle detection" coding (accumulator)
   - its unit test(s)

2. point to the functinality for shifting a row or column 

   - its signature and purpose statement
   - unit tests for rows and columns

3. point to the functinality for inserting a tile into the open space

   - its signature and purpose statement
   - unit tests for rows and columns

If you combined pieces of functionality or separated them, explain.

If you think the name of a method/function is _totally obvious_,
there is no need for a purpose statement. 

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
