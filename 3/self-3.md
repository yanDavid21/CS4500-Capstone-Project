## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. rotate the spare tile by some number of degrees

2. shift a row/column and insert the spare tile
   - plus its unit tests
   
3. move the avatar of the currently active player to a designated spot

4. check whether the active player's move has returned its avatar home

5. kick out the currently active player

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
